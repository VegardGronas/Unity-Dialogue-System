# Unity Dialogue System
A personal project for fun and learning.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a modular dialogue system that can integrate seamlessly with other systems, making it easier to start and continue creating various types of games.

By keeping systems like the player controller and the dialogue system separate, I aim to maintain focus and flexibility while working on individual components. This approach allows me to better understand each system and its development.

Eventually, I plan to combine these standalone systems into a single repository, creating a unified framework for game development.
